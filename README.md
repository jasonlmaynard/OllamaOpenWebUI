THIS SERIES IS EDUCATIONAL ONLY AND MEANT TO EMPOWER DEFENSIVE & OFFENSIVE TEAMS FOR BETTER OVERALL DEFENSIVE OUTCOMES 

Cybersecurity Series focused on Defensive & Offensive security leveraging the power of AI. In this video we will install Ollama and OpenWebUI in Docker on Kali. We will leverage current market AI to see if it will explain how I can crack a password using Kali tools. Perhaps a small surprise as the AI Model first rejects us then we negotiate, and the model does provide some insight before it realizes it does not want to. We then try this with our local model using WhiteRabbit with success. This is just the start of a series of elevating the knowledge of both defensive and offensive players for the better good of security
